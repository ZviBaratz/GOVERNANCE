# Sibling organizations

This document lists the sister organizations to the *NiPreps* organization.
The governance policy that applies to these organizations is the same of individual policies of the *NiPreps Community* Organization, which are described in the `sibling-docs/GOVERNANCE.md` file.
The documents under `sibling-docs` will be stored under a repository called `GOVERNANCE` under each of these sibling organizations.
