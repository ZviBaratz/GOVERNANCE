# The *NiPreps Community*'s Governance Documents [PROPOSAL/WORKING DOCUMENT]

The *NiPreps Community*'s Governance Documents are derived from the [Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) project](https://github.com/github/MVG), adapted following the discussion had within the *NiPreps Governance task-force*, and finally passed by the first elect- Steering Committee on [DATE].

The MVG foundation provides an overall two-tier organizational governance structure for a set of free and open source components of the *NiPreps Framework*.
At the top level (called an "organization" on GitHub; [github.com/nipreps](https://github.com/nipreps/)), there is a technical steering committee to make decisions about the overall direction and coordination between all the organization's projects.
Underneath that top level are the individual projects (e.g., [nipreps/fmriprep](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep)), with lightweight, consensus-based governance.

There are two folders. The first, `org-docs/`, provides top-level organizational governance and polices for a technical steering committee (TSC).
The second folder, `project-docs/`, provides a template for individual project governance, subject to the polices and oversight of the larger organization.
